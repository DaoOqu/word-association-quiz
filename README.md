Words Assocation - Find and choose related words and synonyms for a word or phrase and keep track of your score!

## Available Scripts

Install dependencies

Open two instances of your preferred terminal and run both scripts in order:

### `npm run start:backend`

Retrieves results from the API request onto local port 8000 where the following 'frontend' script uses to gather respective data for the quiz.
This protects our API key from being injected and seen in the source code.

### `npm run start:frontend`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `CTRL + C` 

Run this on each terminal window to kill the scripts and stop the application when finished
